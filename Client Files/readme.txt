The files you need will depend on which method you intend to play Astroflux on: Steam or itch.io client.
For both versions, you need "client.swf"
For the steam version only, you need "Astroflux.swf"
For the itch version only, you need "AstrofluxDesktop.swf"
An QOL script is also included, "clientsetup.exe", which sets up the client in just a couple clicks.
*.exe files are commonly flagged, so if you don't trust it, you can do the setup process yourself.
Just move the two swf files into the correct path, which is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Astroflux" for steam, and "C:\Program Files (x86)\Astroflux" for itch.
To use the exe file, just have the swf in the downloads folder and then run it.

TLDR; Download "client.swf", "Astroflux.swf" if steam, "AstrofluxDesktop.swf" if itch, "clientsetup.exe" to save a few clicks
